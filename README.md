# Final Project

Part I.

The original algorithm approximated Pi by calculating the perimeter of a regular n-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, ln, to the diamater of that circle. The equation we used was provided in class by Dr. Michael Rozman; however, that led to a catastropic precission loss. This was because in the origianal recursion formula the values of sine became infinitesimal for large 'n'. This lead to rather large error values for polygons with sides greater that 2^15.This issue was resolved in this project.
