Final Project

Part I.

The original algorithm approximated Pi by calculating the perimeter of a regular n-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, ln, to the diamater of that circle. The equation we used was derived in class; however, that led to a catastropic precission loss. This was because the origianl equation leads to a 1 - an infinitesimal number for large 'n'. This issue was resolved in this project.
